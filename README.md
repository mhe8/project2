## Introduction about the data

This dataset summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles
published by Mashable in a period of two years. The goal is to predict
the number of shares in social networks (popularity).

In this project, I will try to use the logistic regression and bagging
to classify whether the shares exceeds 1400 or not.
